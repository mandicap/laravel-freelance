## Introduction

Pancake is a self-hosted project management, invoicing, time tracking, and 
prospal tool built on Codeigniter. I used it exclusively throughout my time as a 
freelancer. However, times have changed and Codeigniter just isn't the framework 
Laravel is. Supposedly, there is a major release coming for Pancake; but that 
has been talk for a number of years. 

This is my personal project of a Pancake like tool built on a better and more 
modern codebase.
